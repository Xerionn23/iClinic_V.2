# Appointment Email Notification System

## 📧 Overview

Successfully implemented an **automatic Gmail notification system** for appointments with intelligent 3-day threshold logic.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Smart 3-Day Notification Logic**

### 2. **Professional Email Template**
- Beautiful HTML email with iClinic branding
- Includes appointment details (date, time, type)
- Clinic location and contact information
- Important reminders and instructions
- Responsive design for all devices

### 3. **Automatic Patient Email Detection**

- Falls back to database lookup using patient name
- Queries `students` table `std_EmailAdd` field
- Handles missing emails gracefully

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

```
