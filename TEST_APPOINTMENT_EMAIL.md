## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

1. **Check Spam Folder**
   - Gmail might filter it as spam initially
   - Mark as "Not Spam" if found

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for "✅ Email notification sent successfully"
   - If you see "❌ Gmail Authentication Failed", check Gmail setup

3. **Verify Student Email**
   - Check database: `students` table → `std_EmailAdd` field
   - Make sure email is valid and correct

4. **Check Gmail App Password**
   - Verify in `app.py` line 3370
   - Should be 16 characters, no spaces
   - See `GMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for setup

### Wrong Days Calculation?

1. **Check System Date/Time**
   - Make sure your computer's date is correct
   - System uses current date to calculate days

2. **Check Appointment Date**
   - Verify the date you selected on calendar
   - Console shows: "📅 Days until appointment: X"

### Email Sent But Appointment ≥ 3 Days?

1. **Check Console Output**
   - Should show: "📆 Appointment is X days away (≥3 days)"
   - If it shows "⚡ Appointment is within 3 days!", there's a bug

2. **Verify Date Calculation**
   - Check `app.py` line 11138: `days_until_appointment = (appointment_date_obj - today).days`
   - Should be correct
